### 1. Introduction to "Artemis writes"

Starting from the lively streets of Hyderabad, India, to the land of endless opportunities in the United States, I found myself tangled in a new chapterâ€”the immigrant's story. And guess what? That immigrant is me, dealing with the ups and downs of this thrilling journey.

In 2022, I made the leap across continents, saying goodbye to the familiar surroundings of my homeland to pursue a Master's degree in the US. Over the next two years, I explored 22 states, getting a broad view of America's diverse landscape. From the far west(Cape Flattery) to the far east(Acadia NP), and from the cold north to the warm south, I embarked on a quest to understand the American dream. What sets my experience apart isn't just the vast places I visited, but how deeply this change affected my life.

As I adjusted to a new culture and tried to fit into American life, it hit me harder than I expected. Among friends and fellow students who were in similar boats, my reaction to this change seemed especially deep because of my observant nature. Every change in culture and lifestyle felt like a big deal. This blog is my attempt to share how I see the world now, capturing my journey, how I've adapted, and how I'm still changing.

I'm writing these blogs to give Americans a peek into the life of a legal immigrant trying to find their place in the US. Think of it as a guide, a reality check, and a place for me to share my thoughts. After all, navigating two cultures can feel like dancing to two different tunes at the same time.

In my journey to understand this new country, I've sought guidance from various sources. But perhaps the most valuable insights have come from my own observations and reflections. So here I am, with these insights in hand, sharing the stories of my journey and the quirks I've discovered along the way. These stories also aim to give my fellow Indians back home a reality check, helping them make better decisions if they're thinking about moving to the US. Stay tuned for more of The Immigrant's Tale, where I'll share the quirks, surprises, and maybe a bit of humor that comes with chasing the American dream.
